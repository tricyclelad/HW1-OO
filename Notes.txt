Realized we could avoid creating shapes of innappropriate length, if we made sure that we couldn't create a line of innappropriate length. 
When testing for valid triangles, turns out you can either test for lengths of edges, 
or you can test if the edges have the same slope. If any of the edges on a triangle have the same slope, 
then they are on the same line and not a triangle! Pretty interesting stuff.
